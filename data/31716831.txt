Two new species of butterflies of the genus Argyrophorus Blanchard (Nymphalidae, Satyrinae)-A. idealis n. sp. and A. rubrostriata n. sp.-are described from the Cordillera Negra in north-central Peru. Both, as indicated by colour patterns, male and female genitalia, are related to Argyrophorus lamna (Thieme) which occurs further east and southwards. The new species occur in open puna grassland at approximately 4000 m. One of them is exceptional because both fore and hindwings are uniform shining silvery, in this respect similar only to the Chilean A. argenteus Blanchard.
