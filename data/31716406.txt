The crab spider genus Tarrocanus Simon, 1895 currently includes two species: T. capra Simon, 1895 and T. viridis Dyal, 1935. Recent field work revealed the presence of a new species, providing an opportunity to review the genus. The new species is described as T. jaffnaensis sp. nov. Furthermore, the male of T. capra is described for the first time, and taxonomic notes on Alcimochthes Simon, 1885 and Domatha Simon, 1895 are given, both presumably being close relatives of Tarrocanus. Tarrocanus viridis Dyal, 1935 is considered as nomen dubium.
