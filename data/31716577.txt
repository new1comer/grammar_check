A recent paper dealing with the systematics of Uropeltidae (Pyron et al. 2016) made several taxonomic changes affecting Sri Lankan species in the genera Platyplectrurus GÃ¼nther, 1868; Pseudotyphlops Schlegel, 1839; Rhinophis Hemprich, 1820; and Uropeltis Cuvier, 1829. Space precluded a full discussion of those changes, for which there was a wealth of additional photographs, data, and references. Here, we expand on those alterations and provide further justification with reference to the ICZN (1999) and additional questions for future research.
