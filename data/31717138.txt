A new species, Styloperla starki Zhao, Huo et Du, sp. nov. is described from Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces of eastern coastal China. The new species has a process on the basal cercal segment that bears a pair of small spines, and a process with a pair of ventral, subapical spines. The aedeagus of the male of the new species is membranous, tongue shaped and flat, bearing regular spiral striae with a pair of inner sclerites and with several rows of minute spines on each apical flap. Additionally, we redescribe and illustrate Styloperla jiangxiensis Yang Yang, 1990.
