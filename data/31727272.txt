In vivo experimental models are still essential for advancing our understanding of cancer and developing novel therapeutic strategies, despite rapid and remarkable developments in cellular and molecular technologies. Multiple patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models, in which primary cancer tissues or cells are transplanted into immunodeficient mice, have been developed. PDX models are widely used in the field of precision cancer medicine. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the chick embryo xenograft model, which has a longer history than the athymic nude mouse model.
