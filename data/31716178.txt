The nymphal stages of Tricorythodes pemonensis n. comb. and T. zagaia n.comb. are firstly described. The nymphal characters as well as the characteristic swelling at the base of second forceps segment in male imago justify moving them from Macunahyphes to Tricorythodes. Additionally, other three species described in Macunahyphes are also transferred to Tricorythodes: Tricorythodes araca (Souto Salles) new comb., Tricorythodes eduardoi (Almeida Mariano) new comb., and Tricorythodes incognitus (Molineri et al.) new comb. Macunahyphes australis is the only species that remains in the genus.
