Garra roseae, new species, is described from the stream Tang-e-Sarhe in the Iranian Makran region. It is distinguished from its congeners in the Middle East by lacking barbels, having a small mental disc, 42-58 total scales along the lateral line, 24-30 scales along the predorsal midline, and 20-24 circumpeduncular scales. It is further characterised by having five diagnostic nucleotide substitutions and a minimum K2P distance of 5.39% to G. rossica and 5.49% to G. nudiventris in the mtDNA COI barcode region. Garra phryne from eastern Iran is considered to be a synonym of G. nudiventris.
