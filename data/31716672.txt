Polyphena chongzuoensis sp. nov. is described from China, as the twelfth species of Polyphena Solovyev, 2014. This new species is morphologically similar to P. bana (Cai, 1983), but differs in male genitalia from the latter by short spurs of anellus and aedeagus without obvious apical processes. Male adult and its genitalia are illustrated. The new species is supported molecularly by the analysis of pairwise genetic distances from a 658 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene, with the minimum distance value of 6.4% from its allied species P. annae.
