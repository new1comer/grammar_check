Diabetes mellitus causes several micro- (nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy) and macro-vascular (coronary insufficiency, stroke, lower limb arteriopathy) complications. Some complications are less widely known, particularly the ones involving the musculoskeletal system. Even though diabetes is not specifically linked to these complications, it increases both their incidence and severity. The objective of this paper is to review the main musculoskeletal complications associated to diabetes. It describes the pathophysiology, symptomatology and treatments of these complications.
