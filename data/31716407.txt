The need for reliable taxonomic species identification is always present. Correct identification of specimens is based on taxonomic research, scattered in the scientific literature and accessible only for a restricted group of specialists or research institutions with extensive library facilities (Zuquim et al. 2017). Therefore, identification keys that summarize the knowledge of a group of biota are very important; they provide the link between producers and users of taxonomy. Recently, printed identification keys are increasingly being replaced or supplemented by computer-aided keys.
