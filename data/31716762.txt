The Indian spider species formerly placed in the zodariid genus Lutica Marx, 1891 are revised. The following new combinations are proposed: Tropizodium bengalensis (Tikader Patel, 1975) comb. nov., Tropizodium kovvurensis (Reddy Patel, 1993) comb. nov., Tropizodium poonaensis (Tikader, 1981) comb. nov. and Zodarion deccanensis (Tikader Malhotra, 1976) comb. nov.. T. kovvurensis comb. nov. is redescribed based on freshly collected female specimens. All the examined type specimens are illustrated and the current status of each type is discussed.
