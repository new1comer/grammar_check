Three new species are described in the genus Gyronotus van Lansberge, 1874 (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae), from upland grasslands of South Africa. They are Gyronotus dracomontanus Deschodt Davis, new species, Gyronotus ovalis Deschodt Davis, new species and Gyronotus kearneyorum Deschodt Davis, new species. The South African coastal forest species, Gyronotus marginatus PÃ©ringuey, 1888, status revised, is removed from synonymy with Gyronotus pumilus (Boheman, 1857) and revalidated at species level. An updated key to all South African and eSwatini species is provided.
