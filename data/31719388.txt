Schendylops janelao sp. n. is described from a limestone cave located in eastern Brazil. There are several reports of geophilomorphs in Brazilian caves, however, the new species represents the first troglobite species for South America and the first for Gruta do Janel√£o Cave, northern Minas Gerais State. Schendylops janelao sp. n. is described based on a male specimen and differs from its congeners by a combination of 10 characters. We discuss the character-states related to subterranean life and the conservation status of the species.
