Parabolitobius sinensis a new species of the tachyporine genus Parabolitobius Li, Zhao Sakai, 2000 (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) from the mountainous area of central China, is described and illustrated. It is compared to P. prolongatus (Sharp, 1888) and P. yezoensis Li, Zhao Sakai, 2000, the only two other species occurring in the eastern Palaearctic region. The new species differs mainly in the smaller body size, the strongly reduced hindwings in both sexes, the forms of the elytra, tergite VII, and male tergite and sternite VIII, and the unique configuration of the aedeagus.
