Distribution and host data from published literature and previously unpublished collection records are provided for all 37 species of soft ticks, family Argasidae, that are known to occur in Mexico, including Ornithodoros dugesi, which is generally regarded as a junior synonym of Ornithodoros talaje, and Ornithodoros marinkellei, a new record for Mexico. Parasite-host and host-parasite lists are presented, together with keys to adults and larvae, and a gazetteer of collection localities supplemented by maps showing each species' distribution in Mexico.
