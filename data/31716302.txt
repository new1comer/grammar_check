Mycalesis kagina Fruhstorfer, 1911 is separated from Mycalesis suaveolens Wood-Mason de Nic√©ville, 1883 to represent a species endemic to Taiwan based upon COI barcode divergence, morphological diagnosis of larva, and genitalia of both sexes. Both kagina and suaveolens are confirmed as members of the genus Mycalesis in Mycalesina. Immature morphology, biology, and hostplant associations for both species are given for the first time. Larvae of both species are recognized as specialists on Zingiberaceae, a plant family rarely used by satyrid butterflies.
