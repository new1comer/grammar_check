Tumor models are powerful tools to plan preclinical therapeutic strategies that cannot be conducted on humans. Recently, patient-derived tumor models such as patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and/or patient-derived organoid (PDO), are widely used to investigate the antitumor effects of various drugs, because those tumors resemble original tumors at the physiological and molecular level. In this chapter, we describe patient-derived tumor models of esophageal cancers and outline the latest research as well as the molecular pathology of esophageal cancers.
